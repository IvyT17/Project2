    <h1>Whales</h1>
    <p>There are 6 whale species that are endangered or at risk of being endangered in New York State.
        <br>
        These species are the Sperm Whale, Sei Whale, Blue Whale, Finback Whale, Humpback Whale, and Right Whale.
    </p>
    <h2>The Sperm Whale</h2>

            <p>
                This is the Sperm Whale also known by its scientific name: Physeter catodon. 
                It can be seen in New York waters during Spring and early Summer. Adult males can 
                weigh up to 90,000 lbs and adult females can weigh up to 31,000 lbs. They can grow up to 52 ft and live
                for approximately 70 years. Sperm whales look immensely different from any other whale, donning an enormous
                rectangle-shaped head and a jaw of up to 52 cone-shaped teeth weighing a kilo each. The population of sperm
                whales decreased from 1.1 million to 300,000 as a result of whaling, mainly for commercial reasons such as
                using the spermaceti found in their head cavities for oil lamps and candles. Now, whaling is not as common but
                small-scale whaling still exists off the shores of Long-Island (since the 1640s). Fun fact: sperm whales have
                the largest brains in the world.

                The Sei Whale, also known as Balaenoptera borealis, is one of the least studied species of whales. They
                can be found offshore of New York near the shelf break and can occasionally be found in shore. Sei whales 
                have long sleek bodies that are bluish-gray to black in color. They have a distinct ridge that runs from the 
                nose to their two blowholes. Female sei whales are the bigger of the two sexes and can grow up to 19.5 meters, 
                over 2 meters larger than their male counterparts. Sei whales dive differently from any other whale by leaving 
                the water at a low angle and landing with a belly flop. Approximately 300,000 Sei whales have been killed for 
                their meat and oil. When the numbers of blue and fin whales was depleted, many turned to Sei whales for 
                commercial whaling and this specie in particular is subject to scientific whaling.

    <h2>The Blue Whale</h2>
    <div class="gridalt">
        <div class="info">
            <p>
                This is the Balaenoptera musculus, better known as the Blue Whale. They are the largest animals ever to live
                on our planet and can grow to over 33 meters long. Female blue whales weigh around 190,000kg whereas male blue
                whales only weigh around 150,000kg. Blue whales can feed on as many as 40 million krill daily which they sieve
                through the water using their baleen. The world population of blue whales is merely 10,000-25,0000 due to 
                commercial whaling. Many people hunted them for their large size and blubber which was sold to suppliers
                who would then make from it lamp oil, candles, and etc. It is believed that blue whales use the New York Bight 
                to migrate from summer feeding areas to winter breeding grounds.

                The Sei Whale, also known as Balaenoptera borealis, is one of the least studied species of whales. It does not
                visit New York often and appears to have no seasonal visiting schedule. Sei whales have long sleek bodies that
                are bluish-gray to black in color. They have a distinct ridge that runs from the nose to their two blowholes.
                Female sei whales are the bigger of the two sexes and can grow up to 19.5 meters, over 2 meters larger than their
