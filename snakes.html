    <h1>Snakes</h1>
    <p>There are 5 snake species that are endangered or at risk of being endangered in New York State.
        <br>
        They are the Eastern Massasauga Rattlesnake, Queen Snake, Timber Rattlesnake, Eastern Hognose Snake, and Worm Snake.
        <br>
        (In order from most at danger to least).
    </p>
    <h2>The Eastern Massasauga Rattlesnake</h2>
    <div class="grid">
        <div class="info">
            <p>This is the eastern massasauga rattlesnake. This snake is listed as an endangered species
                in New York. They are found in wetland/swamp areas and wet prairies in central New York as 
                well as in bordering states. The most notable reasons of decline are loss of habitat to 
                development and agriculture, unregulated hunting, and snake collecting. They are also 
                killed because people fear snakes in general and mistakenly think of them to be a threat.

    <h2>The Queen Snake</h2>
    <div class="grid">
        <div class="info">
            <p>This is the queen snake. Although it is one of the more rare snakes in New York, it is 
                labeled as an endangered species in NY. They are found in warm, wet habitats, along rivers 
                and creeks around the east side of the US. These snakes are threatened by habitat destruction 
                from the alteration of habitat features and the fragmentation of habitat by roads or other 
                barriers. They are also greatly affected by any chemical pollutants in the water 
                (plastic, rubber, aluminum, oil/liquids, etc).

    <h2>The Timber Rattlesnake</h2>
    <div class="grid">
        <div class="info">
            <p>This is the timber rattlesnake. This snake is labeled as a threatened species in NY. They 
                are found in forests and rocky areas around the southeast side of the US. These snakes 
                are also threatened by habitat destruction, road mortality, illegal collection and hunting.

    <h2>The Eastern Hognose Snake</h2>
    <div class="grid">
        <div class="info">
            <p>This is the eastern hognose snake. They are listed as special concern, which means they are
                at risk of being endangered. They are found in woody areas, like forests, or sandy areas 
                in the northern parts of New York as well as in some bordering states. The most typical 
                threats include, loss of habitat to suburban development, fragmentation by roads, road 
                mortality, and collection for the pet trade. Like the eastern massasauga, they are often
                killed by people who think of them as threats. Not only are the eastern hognose snakes 
                at risk of becoming endangered, but all sub-species of the hognose species across the 
                US are also in danger for similar reasons.

    <h2>The Worm Snake</h2>
    <div class="grid">
        <div class="info">
            <p>This is the worm snake. They are also listed as special concern. They are found in woody 
                areas in southeastern New York and in bordering states. Their primary threat is habitat 
                loss due to suburban development. Sandy areas that worm snakes inhabit are also frequently 
                used by off-road vehicles. Flooding of wooded lowlands and forest fires are also harmful to
                worm snake populations.

    <h2>How can you help</h2>
    <p>Although there isn't much you can actively do to help these snakes, that doesn't mean 
        you can't help at all. Always follow any Environmental Conservation Laws, which are
        usually outlined on signs near a protected site. Even if there are no signs, the basic 
        actions you should keep in mind is to not litter, on both land and water, and do not 
        start a forest fire. Another big thing youshould be aware of is, if you ever encounter
        a snake, just walk away. Whether or not you have knowledge on snakes. This will protect 
        both you and the snake.
